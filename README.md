## _Introduction_

This repository serves as a public access location for a MATLAB function that supports the **"Simulating the Influence of Temperature Variation on Allowable Storage Time of Shelled Corn"** research paper.  The authors of this research paper are **Bailey J. Adams** (Iowa State University) and **Kurt A. Rosentrater** (Iowa State University).

## _How to use the Dynamic_AST_Calculator.m Function_
The Dynamic_AST_Calculator.m function supports this research paper by adding a level of automation to calculating dynamic allowable storage time (AST) and visualizing responses over time.  This function is intended to be relatively straightforward and user-friendly.

In order to utilize this function, only three inputs must be sequentially specified by the user: bin fill date, minimum or maximum temperature trend, and moisture content (% wet basis).  These three inputs are expressed as "Input_Date", "Input_Temp_Trend", and "Input_Moisture_Content" variables in the first line of the function.
